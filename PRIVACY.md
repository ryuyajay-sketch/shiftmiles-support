# ShiftMiles Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 25, 2026**

## What data we collect

ShiftMiles collects your GPS location while you are actively tracking a shift. This is used to calculate the miles you drove.

## How data is stored

All data is stored locally on your device. We do not have servers and we do not upload your location or shift data anywhere.

## Data sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to anyone. Your mileage logs and location history never leave your phone unless you choose to export a CSV file yourself.

## Location permissions

ShiftMiles requests background location access so it can keep tracking while your screen is off. Location tracking only runs when you tap "Start Shift" and stops when you tap "End Shift."
